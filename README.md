## General Info

* 80s retro theme portfolio with in-page section navigation

## Technologies

* Svelte with sveltekit

## Setup

Fork project and install dependencies

## Developing

Once you've forked and installed dependencies with `npm install` (or `pnpm install` or `yarn`), start a development server:

```bash
npm run dev

# or start the server and open the app in a new browser tab
npm run dev -- --open
```

## Building

To create a production version of the app:

```bash
npm run build
```

> You can preview the built app with `npm run preview`, regardless of whether you installed an adapter. This should _not_ be used to serve your app in production.
> The app currently uses the netlify adapter
> you can install another [adapter](https://kit.svelte.dev/docs#adapters) for your target environment.
